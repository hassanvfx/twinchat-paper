                <h4>🎯 Core Innovation</h4>
                <p>
                    Character responses match the length and style of user input. Short messages get short replies, 
                    long messages get detailed responses, emoji gets emoji back.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>Natural Human Behavior</h3>
            <p>In real conversations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"hey" → "hey! what's up?"</li>
                <li>Long thoughtful message → Long thoughtful response</li>
                <li>"😊🔥" → "😍✨"</li>
                <li>Paragraph → Paragraph back</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Without Reciprocal Length</h3>
            <p>LLMs tend to be verbose:</p>
            <pre><code>User: "k"
LLM: "Thank you for your message! I appreciate you reaching out. 
I wanted to let you know that I've received your response and I'm 
happy to continue our conversation..."

# 😱 Way too much for "k"</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            
            <h3>Core Constraint (Every Prompt)</h3>
            <pre><code># Note: {character_name} responds in reciprocal length
# Note: Reply to short messages with short messages
# Note: Reply to long inquiries with detailed responses  
# Note: Match emoji usage and energy level</code></pre>

            <h3>Emphasis in Instructions</h3>
            <pre><code># Acting as {character_name} Respond as a {relationship} 
# (natural answer in reciprocal length - short to short, long to long)</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Real Examples</h2>
            
            <h3>Short Input → Short Output</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "hey"
Character: "hey! what's up? 😊"

User: "nm wbu"
Character: "same lol just chilling"

User: "k"
Character: "cool 👍"</code></pre>

            <h3>Long Input → Long Output</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "So I've been thinking a lot about my career lately and I'm not sure 
if I'm on the right path. I love what I do but sometimes I wonder if there's 
something else out there that would make me happier. What do you think?"

Character: "wow that's such a real question and honestly I think everyone goes 
through that at some point? like I totally get that feeling of wondering 'is this 
it?' even when things are good. I think the fact that you're asking yourself these 
questions means you're really self-aware which is amazing. maybe it's not about 
finding something completely different but more about finding what specifically 
makes you happy in what you do now and seeing if you can do more of that? idk just 
my thoughts but I'm here if you want to talk through it more 💙"</code></pre>

            <h3>Emoji Input → Emoji Output</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "🔥🔥🔥"
Character: "😍✨ yesss!!"

User: "😢"
Character: "aww what's wrong? 🥺💙"</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="replication">
            <h2>Replication Guide</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Add to Prompt Template</h3>
            <pre><code>def build_prompt(character_name, relationship, last_message):
    prompt = f"""
Acting as {character_name} Respond as a {relationship}
(natural answer in reciprocal length - short to short, long to long)

# RECIPROCAL LENGTH MATCHING:
# Note: {character_name} responds finishing in reciprocal tone
# Note: Match the energy and length of the input
# Note: Short messages get short replies
# Note: Long messages get detailed responses
# Note: Emoji usage should match input
"""
    return prompt</code></pre>

            <h3>Step 2: Test Different Lengths</h3>
            <pre><code>test_cases = [
    ("hey", "Expected: 5-15 chars"),
    ("What's your favorite movie and why?", "Expected: 100-200 chars"),
    ("🔥", "Expected: emoji response"),
    (long_paragraph, "Expected: matching paragraph length")
]</code></pre>
