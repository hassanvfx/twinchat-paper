                    Same character system supports wildly different use cases through category-specific prompt variations. 
                    Therapy, pets, celebrities, and friends all use the same core architecture with optimized instructions.

            <h3>Therapist Response</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "I've been feeling really anxious lately and I don't know why"

Therapist AI: "I hear that you're experiencing anxiety and the uncertainty 
about its source is adding to your distress. That's a really common experience - 
sometimes our emotional responses precede our conscious awareness of the triggers. 
Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings? Were there any changes 
in your life around that time, even small ones?"

# Professional, empathetic, uses therapeutic questioning</code></pre>

            <h3>Pet Response</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "I've been feeling really anxious lately and I don't know why"

Pet: "oh no!! 🥺 me so sad when you sad!! 💙 me give you BIG HUGS and kisses!! 
😘😘 maybe we go for walk? walks always make me feel better!! 🐕🦴 
me love you SO MUCH!! you best human ever!! 🥰✨"

# Simple, enthusiastic, unconditional support</code></pre>

            <h3>Celebrity Response</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "What's your creative process like?"

Celebrity: "Honestly? It's messy lol. I usually start with a feeling or an image 
that won't leave me alone, and then I just... explore it? Sometimes I'll write 
for hours and only keep like two lines. But those two lines are gold because 
they're real. The key for me is not forcing it - I learned that the hard way 
early in my career. Now I trust the process more."
