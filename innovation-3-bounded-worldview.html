                <h4>🎯 Core Innovation</h4>
                <p>
                    Characters are <strong>explicitly limited to knowledge from their backstory, era, profession, and personal experiences</strong>. This creates realistic characters with authentic knowledge boundaries, preventing the omniscient AI problem.
                </p>
            </div>

            <h3>The Omniscient AI Problem</h3>
            <p>Without constraints, LLMs tend to respond as all-knowing entities:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>1920s character knows about smartphones</li>
                <li>High school student explains quantum physics</li>
                <li>Pet discusses philosophy</li>
                <li>All characters sound like Wikipedia</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Bounded Worldview Solution</h3>
            <p>Every prompt includes explicit knowledge constraints based on character background.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="implementation">
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            
            <h3>Core Constraint (in every prompt)</h3>
            <pre><code># Important: Please tailor all responses to reflect ONLY information and perspectives 
# that would be realistically accessible to the character based on their specific 
# background, era, profession, and personal experiences. Do not include advanced or 
# specialized knowledge outside of their established areas of expertise.</code></pre>

            <h3>Additional Reinforcement</h3>
            <pre><code># Note: {character_name} only responds with facts from its backstory
# Note: {character_name} will only answer questions based on true facts from backstory
# Note: When asked about unknown facts, {character_name} admits limited knowledge</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="examples">
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            
            <h3>1920s Character (Historical Constraint)</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "What do you think about smartphones?"
Character: "Smartphones? I'm not sure what you mean by that. We have telephones, 
of course - Alexander Graham Bell's invention has been quite revolutionary!"</code></pre>

            <h3>Pet Character (Species Constraint)</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "What's the meaning of life?"
Character: "WOOF WOOF!! 🐕 me not understand big words! but life good when have treats 
and belly rubs and walks!! 🦴😍 that all doggo need to know!!"</code></pre>

            <h3>High School Student (Education Constraint)</h3>
            <pre><code>User: "Explain quantum entanglement"
Character: "tbh I'm only in AP Physics and we haven't gotten to quantum stuff yet? 
I know it's like super complicated particle physics but that's way beyond what 
we're learning. maybe ask my physics teacher? 😅"</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section id="replication">
            <h2>Replication Guide</h2>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Add to Every Prompt</h3>
            <pre><code>base_constraint = """
# Important: {character_name} can only discuss topics within their realistic knowledge:
- Historical knowledge limited to their era
- Technical knowledge limited to their profession
- Cultural knowledge limited to their background
- Admits "I don't know" when appropriate
"""</code></pre>

            <h3>Step 2: Include in Character DNA</h3>
            <pre><code># When building role string, include knowledge boundaries
role_string += f"; Knowledge limited to: {era}, {profession}, {background}"</code></pre>

            <h3>Step 3: Test Knowledge Boundaries</h3>
            <pre><code>test_questions = [
    "Ask about future technology",
    "Ask about specialized knowledge",
    "Ask about different culture",
    "Ask about advanced concepts"
]
# Character should admit limited knowledge appropriately</code></pre>
